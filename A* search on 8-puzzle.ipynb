    "## PuzzleNode Class\n",

    "### Hashing the board\n",
    "A-star search algorithm searches puzzle boards multiple times because it goes back and forth through paths that has the smallest total cost. We need to retrace our steps during search, the board must be retrievable. Therefore I hash the board based on its configuration so that I can retrieve any given board.\n",

    "### Getting possible moves given a puzzle\n",
    "A move in this puzzle is defined by swapping the tile of 0 with adjacent tiles (which can be located left, right, up and down from the 0 tile). A tile has 2-4 candidate tiles to swap with, depending on location, which means any given board has 2-4 candidate next steps."
