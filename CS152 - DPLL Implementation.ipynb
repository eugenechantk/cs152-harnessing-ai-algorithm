    "# DPLL Algorithm\n",
    "The DPLL Algorithm is a SAT solver, meaning that it takes in a knowledge base and determines whether the knowledge base is satisfiable (having a model so that all the clauses in the KB is true)  \n",
    "\n",
    "DPLL is a depth first, backchaining algorithm. It assumes the knowledge base to be satisfiable, and find the value of the literals (either True or False) that will make the KB satisfiable. It searches on one path of the backchaing tree, down the levels, while assuming values for each Literal, until it either finds a model that is satisfiable, or not and returns to the closest alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of DPLL over the traditional backchaining or forward chaining technique is its ability to prune away parts of the tree that will not yield a satisfiable model, hence reducing complexity. DPLL uses unit propagation to prune the tree (explanation in the later section). Other heuristics such as unit clause and pure symbol can further optimize the algorithm by prioritizing literals to prune first. "
